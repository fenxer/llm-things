| Sticker | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <img src="stickers/claude-code.png" width="400"> | People often see this sentence at the beginning of replies in Claude Code. |
| <img src="stickers/vibe-pr.png" width="400"> | These massive pull requests often contain LLM collaboration. |
| <img src="stickers/pliny.png" width="400"> | TIME100 AI 2025, Pliny the Liberator made the cut. Wait, what? |
| <img src="stickers/coming-weeks.png" width="400"> | The longest time in the world. |
| <img src="stickers/google-translate.png" width="400"> | If you use Google Translate to translate 'LLM' and 'PNG' into Chinese, you will only get the results 'Master of Laws' and 'Papua New Guinea'. |
| <img src="stickers/ai-domain.png" width="400"> | The .ai domain is part of Anguilla's fiscal revenue. |
| <img src="stickers/bg-indigo-500.png" width="400"> | You should ask Adam Wathan, the founder and CEO of Tailwind. |
| <img src="stickers/human-coded.png" width="400"> | Humans make mistakes, but that's why we are human. |
| <img src="stickers/tab.png" width="400"> | Human can press tab. |
| <img src="stickers/anthropic.png" width="400"> | As LLMs have advanced, token prices have been falling â€” except for Anthropic's Claude series. |
| <img src="stickers/grok.png" width="400"> | Even without Ani, Grok is still popular on X. |
| <img src="stickers/deepseek.png" width="400"> | The Chinese in the image means 'Thinking... Oh shit, the user is completely pissed off.'<br />As you can see, DeepSeek model is very popular in China. Users unfamiliar with AI chain-of-thought are curious about what R1 is thinking.<br />This meme came from a user insulting R1, after which the first line of R1's thoughts was that sentence. It became widely spread due to its very colloquial and somewhat humorous tone. |
| <img src="stickers/ollama.png" width="400"> | The Chinese in the picture is 'Good food is worth waiting for'.<br />When Ollama released its desktop application, a Chinese X user asked in Chinese, 'What took you so long?' Ollama, uncharacteristically, replied with an authentic Chinese response. I think this is fun. |
| <img src="stickers/agents-md.png" width="400"> | AGENTS.md Like fire, it always existed until discovered by humans, whose population size and habitat range expanded significantly. |
| <img src="stickers/pelican.png" width="400"> | Simon Willison always uses 'pelican-riding-a-bicycle' to test LLM's ability to generate SVG. Of course, most SVGs are very abstract. |
| <img src="stickers/yc.png" width="400"> | Perhaps because of FOMO, YC has invested in many AI-related companies, even if some of them seem inexplicable. |
| <img src="stickers/gemini.png" width="400"> | Who doesn't love Gemini's Free Tier? |
| <img src="stickers/gpt-trademark.png" width="400"> | OpenAI once tried to register the GPT trademark but was rejected. Recently, their applications to register GPT-5, GPT-6, and so on in China also hit a wall, haha. |
| <img src="stickers/closeai.png" width="400"> | I don't think GPT-OSS was launched for the contribution of the open-source community, but rather to appease the public opinion of CloseAI (personal opinion) |
| <img src="stickers/ghibli.png" width="400"> | For Stable Diffusion players, Ghibli's LoRA is no stranger. However, GPT-4o (or rather, the subsequent gpt-image-1 API) has pushed it into an internet media frenzy.<br />Currently, it's largely unavailable due to copyright reasons, but Sam Altman still hasn't changed his Ghibli-style avatar. Oh my, who's going to rein in this lowercase letter enthusiast? |
| <img src="stickers/strawberry.png" width="400"> | Now everyone basically doesn't let AI count how many r's are in strawberries, but we'll always miss the little strawberry! And the version number. |
| <img src="stickers/bouncing-ball-test.png" width="400"> | Bouncing-ball-test Testing is also one of the LLM's coding ability tests |
| <img src="stickers/mlx.png" width="400"> | MLX is my Mac's savior. |
